The first paper presents an implementation of OWL2, called Scalable OWL 2 Reasoning for Linked Data which purpose is to introduce scalable reasoning and querying techniques to Semantic Web researchers to make use of Linked Data and large-scale ontologies. The second paper presents a study that evaluates and optimizes an OWL2 implementation based on an Event-based eHealth Context with scalability issues.
Moreover, as a general language for representing ontologies and therefore the reality of specific knowledge domains, it can be implemented and extended according to the specific needs without hampering the interoperability.
