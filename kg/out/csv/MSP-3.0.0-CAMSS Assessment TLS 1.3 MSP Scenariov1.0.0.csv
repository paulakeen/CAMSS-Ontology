The process of creating an Internet Standard is straightforward: a specification undergoes a period of development and several iterations of review by the Internet community and revision based upon experience, is adopted as a Standard by the appropriate body... and is published. In practice, the process is more complicated, due to (1) the difficulty of creating specifications of high technical quality; (2) the need to consider the interests of all of the affected parties; (3) the importance of establishing widespread community consensus; and (4) the difficulty of evaluating the utility of a particular specification for the Internet community.

- technical excellence_x000D_
- prior implementation and testing;_x000D_
- clear, concise, and easily understood documentation;_x000D_
- openness and fairness; and _x000D_
- timeliness_x000D_
The goal of technical competence, the requirement for prior implementation and testing, and the need to allow all interested parties to comment all require significant time and effort. The Internet Standards Process is intended to balance these conflicting goals.

These performance improvements are especially evident in browser traffic and less with server-server connection (ebMS).

The biggest improvements are in the area of security, because a number of security risks are limited. This is because unsafe options from TLS 1.2 are excluded, SHA-1, RC4, DES, 3DES, AES-CBC and MD5, which reduces the chance of the protocol being configured in an unsafe manner. Configuration is also simpler, which means there is less chance of incorrect configuration
